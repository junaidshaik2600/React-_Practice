# React Counter Application

## Description

This project is a simple counter application built using **React.js**. The primary functionality allows users to increment and decrement a counter value within a defined range. The application demonstrates basic state management using React's `useState` hook and provides an interactive interface for the user to modify the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment Button**: The counter value can be increased by clicking the "Add value" button. The value will increment by 1 until it reaches a maximum of 20.
- **Decrement Button**: The counter value can be decreased by clicking the "Remove value" button. The value will decrement by 1 until it reaches a minimum of 0.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage and update the counter value dynamically.
- **Conditional Logic**: Prevents the counter from exceeding the maximum (20) or falling below the minimum (0) through conditional checks.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junaidshaik2600/React_Practice/tree/main/hooksProject
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd hookProject
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the app**:  
   The application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Explanation

The core functionality of the application is encapsulated in the `App.jsx` file. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- **State Management**:  
  The application initializes the counter value with a default of `5` using `useState`.
  ```javascript
  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(5);
  ```

- **Increment Logic**:  
  The `addValue` function increments the counter by 1 as long as the value is less than 20.
  ```javascript
  const addValue = () => {
    if (counter < 20) {
      setCounter(counter + 1);
    }
  };
  ```

- **Decrement Logic**:  
  The `removeValue` function decreases the counter by 1, but ensures it doesn't go below 0.
  ```javascript
  const removeValue = () => {
    if (counter > 0) {
      setCounter(counter - 1);
    }
  };
  ```

- **UI Elements**:  
  The JSX code renders the counter's current value and provides two buttons to increment and decrement the value.
  ```javascript
  return (
    <>
      <h1>junaid</h1>
      <h2>Counter Value: {counter}</h2>
      <button onClick={addValue}>Add value {counter}</button>
      <button onClick={removeValue}>Remove value {counter}</button>
    </>
  );
  ```

## Conclusion

This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of using React for basic state management and UI interaction. By limiting the counter's range and providing interactive buttons, the app showcases conditional rendering and the use of `useState` in React applications.
